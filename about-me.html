<h1 style="font-style:bold;text-align:center;">About Me</h1>
<body style="text-align:center;">
My life as a martial artist is neither interesting nor worthy of explaining here. However, for the sake of solidarity, I will explain a few things about myself.
<br> I have a deep love for physicality and training. 
I believe that movement is capable of being a panacea for a 
multitude of severe chronic diseases and maintaining or improving mental acuity.<br>
As such, martial arts and subsequently this website and other projects are to be observed as passions of mine. Passion projects that span a lifetime.<br>
Within the 15 years or so I've been training, I've had the pleasure to train with world class martial artists and instructors, of which I will list below for your reference. I will also list the styles that have
been the most influential on me over the years.<br>
Outside of training, I love my family and choose to spend most of my free time with my wife and son. There is nothing that I need to see or know beyond them.<br>
